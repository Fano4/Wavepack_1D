# Wavepack_1D
Quantum propagation of electronic-vibrational wavepacket including photoionization in 1D molecules

The code works with a set of data files whose locations are provided along with the parameters in the input file ( eg. wvpck_input.in)

For all the data files to be used  by the dynamics, only the rootname is provided in the main input file. The data files are single column files representing values along the grid. Their name has to be formatted as: "filename_stati.input", where stati has to be replaced by the state index.
For coupling files, the filename has to be formatted as : "filename_stati_statj.input". The corresponding matrix elements should be <stati|J|statj>

Only the rootname has to be provided in the input file. for instance, if the sought filename is "filename_stati.input", we write only "filename_" in the input file and the code will fill the blank

Structure of the input file wvpck_input.in:

location of the neutral PEC files
location of the cation PEC files
location of the neutral_dipole_files
location of the cation dipole files
